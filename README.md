# Healthcare-informatics-and-disease-prediction
Analytics and predictive modeling application on the health, biological, and disease data 

## Health informatics

- 🌍 **[Global Mortality Cause Analysis - Indonesia](https://github.com/harishmuh/Global_Mortality_Indonesia)**

  * Analyzed 30 years of global mortality data, highlighting disease trends in Indonesia compared to global patterns. 

## Disease prediction
- 🩺 **[Early Risk Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/Early-Risk-Diabetes-predictor-Machine-Learning-and-app)**
  * Developed a model to predict prediabetes risks using research data.
- ❤️ **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/Heart-diseases-prediction-Machine-Learning--App)**
  * Created a classifier to assess heart disease risks based on medical records.
- 🧬 **[Acute Leukimia Prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/Gene-Expression_Acute-Leukimia_MLClassification)**
  * Constructed a prediction model based on gene expression data (DNA microarray) to discriminate whether a patient's acute leukemia case is considered as AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) or ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia)
