# Healthcare analytics and disease prediction machine learning
Analytics and predictive modeling application on the health, biological, and disease data 


### Health analytics

- 🌍 **[Global Mortality Cause Analysis - Indonesia](https://github.com/harishmuh/Global_Mortality_Indonesia)**

  * Analyzed 30 years of global mortality data, highlighting disease trends in Indonesia compared to global patterns. 


### Disease prediction
- 💊 **[Early Risk Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/Early-Risk-Diabetes-predictor-Machine-Learning-and-app)**
  * Developed a model to predict prediabetes risks.
- ❤️ **[Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/Heart-diseases-prediction-Machine-Learning--App)**
  * Created a classifier to assess heart disease risks from patient data.
- 🧫 **[Acute Leukimia Prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/Gene-Expression_Acute-Leukimia_MLClassification)**
  * Used gene expression (microarray) data to classify two types of Acute leukemia (AML vs ALL).
- 🧬 **[COVID19 positivity prediction](https://github.com/harishmuh/COVID19_Prediction/tree/main)**
  * Modeled patient test results to predict COVID-19 positivity.


### 📊 Data Visualization
- 🌐 **[Dashboard of the COVID-19 Cases in Indonesia](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid19inIndonesia_17550082493800/DashboardofCovid19CasesinIndonesia?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**: Updated COVID-19 dataset (till 15th September 2022)



### 📱 Apps with Machine Learning based Models
